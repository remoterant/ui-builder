                                Client rendering is the most flexible, but comes with all these serious downsides like
                                worse performance, worse
                                reliability, more strain on devices, bad SEO, etc. Static pre-rendering is the most
                                robust, speedy, and secure, but is
                                the most limited. Edge functions on top of static is starting to open doors, but
                                server-rendering is the classic mix of
                                flexibility and speed that has dominated the web for good reason.
                            </p>

                                Client rendering also opens the door for that “SPA” (Single Page App) feel. I still like
                                that, personally. I like the
                                no-page-refresh feel. It’s makes a site feel snappy and opens the door for page
                                transitions. Gatsby is famous for
                                popularizing hydration, where you get the pre-rendered static bonus, but then the
                                upgrade into SPA as the JavaScript
                                downloads.
                            </p>

                                I’d love to see the web get to the point where we get all that “good feel” bonus of an
                                SPA without actually having to
                                build an SPA. It’s notable when frameworks provide SPA feels without having to manage
                                much of that yourself, but still,
                                something is managing it and that something is a bunch of JavaScript.
